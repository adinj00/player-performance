# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation change.

This file intentionally starts lightweight. It should become more detailed as build units are added under `/feature-specs` and implementation work begins.

## Current Phase

- Foundation context setup

## Current Goal

- Finalize the project context files before creating the first build plan and feature specs.

## Completed

- Product discovery completed for the initial V1 scope.
- Core V1 product direction defined: internal FK Velež Mostar player performance and match analysis system.
- Initial context files drafted:
  - `context/project-overview.md`
  - `context/architecture.md`
  - `context/ui-context.md`
  - `context/code-standards.md`
  - `context/ai-workflow-rules.md`
- Root `AGENTS.md` reviewed and kept as the universal context entry point.

## In Progress

- `context/progress-tracker.md` initial setup.

## Next Up

- Create the build plan under `/feature-specs`, starting with a numbered implementation sequence.
- Then create the first scoped feature spec before any implementation begins.

## Open Questions

- Obtain real Gpexe CSV/XLSX export samples and document confirmed import fields.
- Obtain real Zone14 export samples, if available, and document confirmed data fields.
- Confirm whether Zone14 provides any structured event data or only video/tagging/running-stat support.
- Select the production hosting provider later.
- Select the production object storage provider later.
- Decide when Docker and Docker Compose should be introduced.
- Confirm final media/video storage constraints after production hosting direction is known.

## Architecture Decisions

- The application is a single-club system for FK Velež Mostar; multi-club tenancy is out of scope for V1.
- V1 focuses primarily on match performance analysis, with training support limited mainly to GPS/physical workload tracking.
- Players are persistent club entities and move through teams using time-bound assignment history.
- Teams/selections are configurable and use tracking levels: basic, standard, and full.
- The access model uses one primary role per user, team scopes, and limited explicit permission flags.
- Analysts can review match reports by default and can verify reports only when granted verification permission.
- Backend uses ASP.NET Core 8, PostgreSQL, Clean Architecture, Vertical Slice organization in the Application layer, and Minimal APIs endpoint groups.
- Frontend uses React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, nuqs, Zustand for limited global UI state, Zod, React Hook Form, TanStack Table, and shadcn/Recharts charts.
- The UI is light-only and follows FK Velež red, white, and gold identity.
- Bosnian Latin is the default UI language; English may be supported as an optional selectable UI language.
- Local development uses `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env.local`; production uses real environment variables or a managed secret store.
- Docker is out of scope for the initial local development setup and may be introduced later.
- Exact Gpexe and Zone14 import mappings must not be guessed before real export samples are reviewed.

## Session Notes

- No implementation work has started yet.
- `/feature-specs` should be used for build plans and scoped feature specs.
- `context/progress-tracker.md` should be updated when a feature spec is started, completed, or when a meaningful implementation change occurs.
- If implementation changes product scope, architecture, UI rules, code standards, or workflow rules, update the relevant context file before continuing implementation.
